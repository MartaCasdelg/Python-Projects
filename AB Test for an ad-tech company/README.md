# A/B Testing Analysis for an ad-tech company

![Portada](https://socital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/thumbnail-ab-testing.jpg)

An impression bidding model, in the context of online advertising and digital marketing, refers to the strategy used by advertisers and advertising platforms to determine how much they are willing to pay to have their ad displayed to a specific user when that user visits a website or application. This process is fundamental to the purchase of online advertising space and the optimization of advertising campaigns. Given the previous information, the case of a company is presented as follows. 

An advertising technology company recently introduced a new impression bidding model for their online advertising campaigns, Average Bidding, as an alternative to their existing bidding model, Maximum Bidding. A client running a retargeting advertising campaign (advertising targeted to people who have previously interacted with your brand) using the Maximum Bidding model has decided to test this new bidding model and wants to **conduct an A/B test to understand if Average Bidding performs better than Maximum Bidding**.

In this project I explain what is an AB test and how to analyze its results using the pingouin, scipy, pandas and seaborn libraries, among others. Specifically, in the notebook I will show step by step how to develop the analysis, including sections on data preparation and data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and the development of the relevant hypothesis tests.
