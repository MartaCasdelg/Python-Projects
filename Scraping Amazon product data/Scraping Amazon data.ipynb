This is why **I have created a function (pages_to_scrap) that takes as parameter a number given by the user that defines the number of pages to scan**. The function then iterates over a range of numbers from 1 to this number and creates a new url by attaching the current number to the url via the \"page\" parameter. Each url is stored in the variable 'urls'.\n"

    "The **next step is to obtain data of the products within each page** (each link within urls). To do this we can use the **get method in each url**, but to make it work it is necessary to set the parameter headers with information from our device (to simulate a web search). Otherwise, Amazon will detect our activity and could block us, since it has a very strict policy regarding data extraction. You can review Alex the analyst's video in the readme.md references to see how to obtain this data.\n",

    "Now comes the interesting part, to get the data (assuming status code = 200) we must **parse the html** we got in the answer. Doing this, we will be able to use the functions **find** and **find_all** to extract the information we need. **But what should we look for with these functions?** At this point we must be clear that the answer we have parsed actually contains all the html of the Amazon page, which holds the code that displays the information we see on the web when we scroll through the page (product names, prices, etc.). We can see that code if we hit F12 while we are on the web, so we can scroll down and look for the code snippets where the desired information is located. Once we find it, we can use the find and find_all functions to search for keywords in the html code and get that information.\n",

I suggest you to use this tool to familiarize yourself with the structure of the html code.\n",
