## Description

In this project, I will show you **step by step how to extract information from all the products in a category of Amazon**. 

We will see what libraries are needed, what we can do to scrap all the products from several pages, how to check the html of the web to find the data we need and what functions to use to extract the information. Additionally I will show you how to save the output in a dataframe.

In order to facilitate the readability and comprehension of the code, I will put explanations before each code cell about what is about to be done and how to do it.
