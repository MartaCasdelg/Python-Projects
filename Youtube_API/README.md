## Description
This data mining project shows step by step how to make calls to the Youtube API in order to acquire information about the videos of a channel and their respective statistics. At the same time, the project includes a section showing how to import the obtained results to a cloud database (in this case AWS) with Python.

Please note that in order to replicate this project you need to have a google developer account and a credential to be able to make youtube API calls. In addition, this repository assumes that you already have a database in AWS. However, in the references section there are blogs and tutorials that you can review to solve these parts.
